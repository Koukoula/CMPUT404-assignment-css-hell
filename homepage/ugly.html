    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/PotyKoukoulas.jpg" alt="Poty" width=87 height=129 style="float:left;" />
	I am fourth year student of the University of Alberta graduating this spring with a Specialization in Computing Science, as well as the University’s Certificate in Computer Game Development. I’ve been playing videogames for as long as I can remember, and it’s my goal in life to create the same sort of games I fell in love with. As well as my passion for game design, I also enjoy writing and animation, and hope to continue practicing these skills for the years to come. Ideally, I hope in the future to be able to combine these skills and make my own books, animations, audio dramas and, of course, videogames that all share the same setting, designed by me, of course.
    <p></p><h2>My History</h2>
    <img src="assets/TheCoreScreenshot.png" alt="game-icon" width=100 height=100  style="float:right;" />
	While getting my certificate in game design at the University of Alberta, I have created a variety of games. I have used a variety of tools, ranging from simple engines like Scratch and Project spark, to more professional environments like Game Maker and Unity. Some of these games were for class projects, and others were created for local Edmonton game jams. Additionally, I was invited to be a Grading Assistant for the University’s Game Design: Principles and Practice course and have assisted them in marking students games for two years. I have also served as an executive member of the University’s Video Game Art and Design club.
    <p></p><h2>What I Have to Offer</h2>
    <img src="assets/ScreenshotFinalScene.png" alt="animation-icon" width=100 height=100 style="float:left;" />
    I have experience in making games for a variety of mediums and audiences, and severely enjoy doing so. I consider myself clever and creative, especially when it comes to a game design problem. Additionally, I have developed skills needed for a variety of tasks needed when developing a game, from audio and animation programs, to writing and coding. But, above all else, I enjoy designing games, and coming up with a creative solution to any problem that arises.
